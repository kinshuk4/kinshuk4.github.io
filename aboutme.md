My name is Kinshuk Chandra. Here is a what you should know about me:

Before that, I worked at Microsoft in the Bing Team and won innovation award for Query Explorer, which was one stop portal containing the search query information, and I contributed significantly by not only developing and deploying the necessary infrastructure but also devising a model which named the entities related to the search query. Later, I designed Athena, a pipeline for pushing high precision data to Bing Search Charm, which was integrated to Windows8.1 and on-boarded 8 partners for the pipeline.
