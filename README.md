My Github Pages Repo to contain github portfolios.

To add the tab in the website, just edit _config.yml, and add the website under navbar-links.
To enable or disable the profile urls like stackoverlow or linkedin just put it under section - author. 
Also, in the footer html we are using font awesome. So icons are already available. For example for stackoverflow, we are referring to the class - fa-stack-overflow.
